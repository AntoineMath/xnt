# xnt :croissant:
XNT is the most simple webapp to get a fast daily overview on arxiv research papers, in your field of interest.

Right now, you get `cs.AI` categorized papers for the past `24h`. You can change it easily in the code.

## Roadmap
1. using gpt-3 model to further reduce the article abstract without loosing key points
2. using gpt-3 model to sum up the entire article
3. improve readibility 
4. provide some customization options (different categories, etc...)
5. all of this might just end up turned into a cli tool
